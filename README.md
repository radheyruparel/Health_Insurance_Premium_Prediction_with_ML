# Health Insurance Premium Prediction with Machine Learning

A person who has taken a health insurance policy gets health insurance coverage by paying a particular premium amount. There are a lot of factors that determine the premium of health insurance. 

The amount of the premium for a health insurance policy depends from person to person, as many factors affect the amount of the premium for a health insurance policy. For example, age, a young person is much less likely to have major health problems compared to an older person. Thus, treating an older person will be expensive compared to a young one. That is why an older person is required to pay a high premium compared to a young person.

The dataset consists of:

1) the age of the person
2) gender of the person
3) Body Mass Index of the person
4) how many children the person is having
5) whether the person smokes or not
6) the region where the person lives
7) and the charges of the insurance premium

   After using different machine learning algorithms, I found the random forest algorithm as the best-performing algorithm for this task. Hence, I will train the model by using the random forest regression algorithm.
